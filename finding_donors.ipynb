    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "AdaBoost:\n",
    "1. Is a classification algorithm, can be applied to predicting whether or not a patient has a certain disease based on previous health history, any problem in which a yes/no decision can be made\n",
    "2. This model combines three different models into one to minimize error. The first model is a decision tree based off of the training data, the second model builds off of the first to increase accuracy, and the third again aims to reduce error. This boosting technique, where one model aims to better predict than the next by changing the weights on correct and incorrect predictions, helps to reduce bias error.\n",
    "3. If the dataset has a lot of outliers, then it will not make as accurate a prediction because the model will not know what values to build off of.\n",
    "4. This model makes a good candidate for the problem because most input values are categorical, which are now binary, so there cannot be that many outliers in the dataset. Additionally, if the model places initial weights on the inputs, these weights can be changed depending on whether the prediction for target income was correct or not pretty easily, since there are only two values for most of the variables and the numerical columns have been transformed to lie between 0 and 1. Additionally, because the question is ultimately asking the model to make a decision about a certain row of data, a sequential algorithm would be useful to make this decision because it depends on the errors of its predecessors and can therefore improve its prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines\n",
    "1. Can be used to classify voters as Republican or Democrat based on their personal data\n",
    "2. This algorithm performs well when there is a clean cut between 2 sections of the data. It also performs better when there are higher dimension to the hyperplane that separates the two data sections since more dimensions means more flexibility\n",
    "3. This algorithm does not perform well when the dataset is large, because this means that the hyperplane will have to readjust several times for each point in the set and there are more points. It will also not do well when the number of features in a dataset is larger than the number of values in the training data because this means that the number of dimensions is greater than the number of values, so the model will not be able to create the hyperplane.\n",
    "4. This model makes a good candidate for the problem because there is enough data for the model to create a boundary and margins for 2 separate sections but not too much where it will take too much time. Additionally, while this problem does not have a clear distinction in its data just by looking at the table, it does have several categorical values that have been converted into binary values that might be the same for each entry depending on if the target value is <=50K or >50K.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression\n",
    "1. Is used in predictive models for credit scoring\n",
    "2. This algorithm's strengths include that it is easily interpretable, it's easy to find out which inputs have a larger impact on the final result of the prediction, and the optimal number of features can be found .\n",
    "3. It cannot necessarily capture more complex relationships or multiple features and decision boundaries.\n",
    "4. Logistic Regression is easy to interpret, there is one target variable so logistic regression will be able to classfiy a data point in one of 2 ways."

    "The AdaBoostClassifier model, which is an ensemble supervised learning method, is the most appropriate for the task of identifying individuals that make more than $50,000. This is because this model has the greatest f-score on 100 percent of the testing set, takes a very short amount of time to both train and predict, and can be applied to any number of values in the set. When looking at the metrics, Logisitc Regression, AdaBoost, and SVC were all close in performance, with SVC being sligthly higher in accuracy and f-score on the training set, but on the testing set, Adaboost was higher in both accuracy and f-score, which indicates that AdaBoost is a better predictor of whether or not a certain individual makes above or below 50K. Comparing the sizes of the sets used (ie when 1, 10, or 100 percent) of the training data is used, the answer remains the same because the differences in scores for each of the respective models is negligible across the training set sizes. In terms of prediction time, Logistic Regression took the least amount of time, as you can not even see it on the charts comparing Model Training and Model Predicting time. However, AdaBoost does not take much time either, as you can barely see it on the Model Predicting chart, indicating that there is not much of a time difference between the two and therefore time does not have as much of an impact when comparing performance between the two. However, SVC takes a significantly longer amount of time to perform, which means that SVC is not as efficient of an algorithm to use, probably because the dataset is very large. This means that although accuracy and f-score between AdaBoost and SVC are close, SVC is not the best algorithm to use. AdaBoost has the highest f-score, meaning that precision for the model is higher than the other two, and its time is short, so it is the best algorithm to use in this case. In terms of the algorithm's sustainability for the data, the metrics indicate that if the number of entries were to increase, AdaBoost would continue to provide a higher f-score and accuracy value. As the testing size grows, the metrics remain stable, indicating that the values would remain the same as the data grows."

    "AdaBoost is a classification algorithm that works sequentially to predict values. There are 3 weak learners that, when combined, build up off of each other to minimize error. The first weak learner is a decision tree, but it's a stump tree. It only has 1 parent node and its 2 children are leaves, meaning it only uses one variable to base its decision off of. The first weak learner classifies the training data, and each data sample has equal weights. There is a stump for each variable. The second learner then looks at how many data points are correctly and incorrectly labeled by each stump, and changes the weights of the samples depending on how they are classified, so the points incorrectly classfied have higher weight. Then the next time they are classified, they will be classified correctly. There is also a higher weight on classifiers that classify points more correctly, so higher weight means higher accuracy. The third learner builds on this and completes the same process until the maximum iteration is reached and the points are as accurately identified as possible."

    "I expected Age, Hours per Week, and Education to be key features that determine income. I did not expect, however, for capital gains and losses to have such a large impact, greater than that of Occupation and Native Country. I also did rank Age, Hours per Week incorrectly, but I did rank Education correctly, as it has the largest weight in determining income level. This visualization confirms the assumption that education and hours per week are important for determining income level, but I did not think age was as relevant as it is. Seeing the visualization, I guess it makes sense because the data show that the majority of older people do make above 50K and therefore it is a decisive feature. Additionally, with capital gains and losses, I wasn't sure how these features would indicate level of income. However, I can see that people with higher income tend to invest more, and therefore this will lead to a higher level of gains or losses from investments. Those with higher incomes will make greater capital gains and therefore that is an important factor in predicting income level, and with investing, the risk of losing capital is there too. Capital gains seems to have a greater importance than losses because gains can only be made when the investment is profitable, but losses can be made without having to make an investment, meaning that those below 50K who do not invest could also lose money.

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The Final Model trained on reduced data has less accuracy and a lower f-score as compared to the full data. This is becuase reducing the number of factors to only the 5 most important will lead to a greater number of incorrectly identified data points, but this has only gone down by a very small portion. If training time were a factor, I would consider using the reduced data as my training set, because training and testing such large amounts of data with 13 total factors takes up a lot of time and the accuracy and f-score values are not as much different as just when testing with 5."
